# mipfp - Multidimensional Iterative Proportional Fitting and Alternative Models

An implementation of the iterative proportional fitting (IPFP), 
maximum likelihood, minimum chi-square and weighted least squares procedures
for updating a N-dimensional array with respect to given target marginal 
distributions (which, in turn can be multi-dimensional). The package also
provides an application of the IPFP to simulate multivariate Bernoulli
distributions.
